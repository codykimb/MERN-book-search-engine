# Book Search Engine

## DESCRIPTION
For this project, I took fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

I did the following:

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

- Modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

- Created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
